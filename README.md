# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I am Luke, a full stack developer with extensive experience in design and web/app development.

I started building websites in highschool (2004) and since then I have been honing my skills in UX, UI, and various programming languages and frameworks.

I have worked on numerous projects as a systems architect and UI/UX consultant, ensuring that different designs and ideas can be implemented smoothly and efficiently on various platforms (such as AWS services, Azure, custom Virtual and dedicated servers, etc.). My main tools are React.js and React Native, Node.js, which I use to develop apps for web, iOS and Android.

If you are looking for a high quality custom product that is not based on themes or standard solutions, please contact me for more information at luke@spaceout.pl

You can also check out my personal site in English spaceout.pl or my Polish blog about development and other adventures in my professional life. https://blog.spaceout.pl

On a personal note, I am a huge fan of Star Wars, Marvel and DC comic books, Funk and 80s music. I get most of my design inspiration from offline experiences like visiting art museums, galleries and collaborating with other creative people on various projects. I also work with various activists and NGO groups as a pro-bono designer and developer.

- :guardsman: â€‹Implementing compliance and security protocols at my current job, using the DevSecOps (#OWASP) principles, using such tools as self-hosted azure dev ops dependobot, static code and security analysis on 13 commercial projects.
