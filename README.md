### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luke and I am full stack developer.
I have built my first website way back in highschool (2004), and since then I have been perfecting my skills in both design, (UX, UI) and web/app development.

For many years now, I have been involved in various projects as a systems architect and UI/UX consultant. I make sure that various designs and ideas can be implemented swiftly and without headache to all major platforms (such as AWS services, Azure, custom Virtual and dedicated servers,). My area of expertise is React.js and React Native, Node.js and Svelte ecosystem, which I use to develop Apps for all the major platforms (Web, iOS and Android).

If you are looking for a high quality custom product, that is not based on themes or standard solutions. Contact me for more info at info@spaceout.pl.

If you are a developer, take a look at my Polish blog about development and other adventures in my professional life. https://blog.spaceout.pl

Personally, I am a big geek with huge love for Star Wars, Marvel and DC comic books, Funk and 80s music. I take most of my design inspiration from offline experiences like going to art museums, galleries and working with other creative people on various projects. I also work with various Activist and NGO groups as a pro-bono designer and developer.
